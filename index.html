                <p>As processes become increasingly more automated, jobs that were once done by humans are now done by computers. Because of this, we see algorithmic bias cropping up more and more. When humans did these jobs, they were often governed not just by processes of fairness and transparency, but also by federal, state, and local laws.</p>
                <p class="hidden-text">Let’s look at some examples of algorithmic bias in practice. </p>

                <p>In 2014, Amazon implemented an algorithm that would screen resumes for its engineering roles. Over time, the algorithm learned that Amazon hires far more men than women for its engineering roles and began to favor men’s resumes over women’s resumes. </p>
                <p>The algorithm mistakenly assumed that Amazon hired more men than women because men were better candidates for the engineering jobs, rather than because there are fewer women in engineering, overall, and therefore fewer women hired to engineering roles. The algorithm went so far as to downgrade resumes that contained the word “women’s” and blacklist candidates out of women’s colleges, before it was ultimately decommissioned. </p>

                <p>In 2020, as the world began to lock down due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of users on video conferencing platforms like Zoom skyrocketed. Zoom users very quickly noticed issues in its facial recognition algorithms which were used to generate virtual backgrounds while keeping the user’s face visible. The algorithm, when in use, would remove the heads of Black users, thinking that their faces were part of the background. The same was not the case for users of other skin tones. </p>
                <p>A similar issue was also seen in Twitter’s automated cropping algorithm. In 2020, users noticed that Twitter’s cropping algorithm was removing Black faces from its image previews in Tweets. In response, Twitter conducted a study on this “cropping bias” and found that, between men and women there was an 8% demographic parity in favor of women, between Black and white individuals, there was a 4% demographic parity in favor of white individuals. Between Black and white women, there was a 7% demographic parity in favor of white women, and between Black and white men, there was a 2% demographic parity in favor of white men. As a result, Twitter changed its cropping algorithm to display standard aspect ratio images in full, i.e. without cropping. </p>

                <p>Machines are built by people with bias, trained on data collected by humans with bias, and often tested with humans with bias. Because of this, algorithms risk replicating and amplifying human biases.</p>

                <p>In 2015, users of Google Photos discovered that the automated tagging function of the application was labeling Black people as gorillas. This feature was implemented as a way of being able to search through photos more easily, identifying specific faces, objects, etc. When this was discovered, Google immediately put in a bug fix that removed the gorilla label entirely such that nothing within the photo library could be labeled “gorilla” and stated that they would be working on “longer-term fixes.” </p>
                <p class="hidden-text">As of 2018, Google Photos still could not identify any gorilla images. Wired Magazine tested 40,000 images of animals in Google Photos and the application could identify many animals including pandas and poodles, but returned “no results” for search terms “gorilla”, “chimp”, “chimpanzee”, or “monkey”. The application could, however, identify “baboon”, “gibbon”, “marmoset”, and “orangutan”.</p>

                <p>In 2018, Nijeer Parks was falsely accused of shoplifting and arrested based on facial recognition software used by local police departments. This is not an isolated case, more and more, facial recognition is being used by law enforcement, courts, and other entities to identify crime suspects and make arrests.</p>
                <p>Facial recognition software is used by law enforcement around the world in order to identify potential suspects based on security camera footage and pictures. A study by Georgetown Law’s Center on Privacy and Technology found that over 117 million American adults (nearly 1 in 2) are in facial recognition networks used by police departments.</p>
                <p>The databases used to populate these systems mainly come from drivers license photos and mugshot data. Historically, the data used to investigate crimes was mainly made up of fingerprint and DNA data, which could only be obtained through previous criminal arrests or investigations. Now, these databases are primarily made up of law-abiding citizens.</p>

                <p>Black Americans are more likely to be singled out, especially when mug shot data is used. The overrepresentation of Black faces in mug shot data means that Black faces are consequently more likely to be falsely matched and have more opportunity to be falsely matched, producing biased results. </p>
                <p>Facial recognition tends to perform more poorly on darker faces generally. The research on this subject is limited, however, there could be a few factors at play. First, the dataset may not be diverse enough. Second, it could be that darker skin has less contrast and generally machine learning models are looking for very minute patterns. Third, security camera footage tends to be top down and drivers license photographs vary state by state which can cause discrepancies in results even when a person is present in the database. </p>
                <p>In general, people have dopplegangers, people who look vaguely like them, and inevitably, looking at a billion people, statistically, there will be people who look very similar even if they are not related. </p>

                <p>In 2019, researchers found that a health care risk-prediction algorithm used by hospitals across the United States (on more than 200 million patients) was giving racially biased results. The algorithm was used to help hospitals and insurance companies direct resources to patients that would benefit from “high-risk care management,” such as specialized nursing, extra primary-care visits, etc. in order to preempt more serious medical care and hospitalization, thereby reducing cost. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text">The algorithm was found to use healthcare spending as a proxy for medical need, resulting in Black patients receiving lower risk scores than their corresponding White counterparts, while not accounting for the implicit racial bias in the healthcare system, which causes Black patients to have more distrust in the healthcare system overall, thereby making them less likely to request extra care and less likely to spend money on healthcare. </p>

                <p>In 2016, Microsoft released their artificial intelligence chatbot Tay onto Twitter.

When it was released on March 23, 2016, Tay began replying to Twitter users and captioning photos to be memes. </p>
                <p>Twitter users quickly exploited Tay, tweeting politically incorrect and inflammatory messages to the bot. Tay had been programmed with some topic blacklisting, including the murder of Eric Garner, for which the bot would generate default, safe, canned answers. However, the bot, as a result of these tweets, began to tweet racist and sexually-charged messages to other Twitter users. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text">Tay’s behavior was unexpected but understandable. Tay learned only by mimicking other users and had no concept of inappropriate behavior.

                <hr class = "line">
                <p>The most important thing that an individual can do is to change the way that they think about algorithms and technology. We, as humans, have a tendency to hold technology up as morally superior and think that it stands above human bias. But the truth is, the technology that we have cannot exist without data that is produced through exclusion, bias, and inequity. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text">The tendency to lift technology, innovation, and technology CEOs and to think that “they can do no wrong,” or that “they work faster, and therefore, better than humans,” is inherently flawed. And always wanting the newest, shiniest thing, the newest technology, and wanting it fast, perpetuates the neverending fast-paced cycle, and the idea that technology is better than humans, and not fallible, contributes to more algorithmic bias and more issues in technology, overall. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-2">Individuals should report problems when they see them. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-3">This is an incomplete solution, because these systems are often audited by real people. Content moderators at social media platforms like Tik Tok and Facebook have talked about the explicit, violating, and sometimes violent behavior they’ve had to screen on their platforms, even going so far as to sue these companies for the mental strain and post traumatic stress care caused. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-3">Moreover, these decisions are left to personal assessment by content moderators. Do we want these individuals to be our moral compass? And how do we fix this problem on a global scale? Especially when the content is not in English. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-3">We need assurances that once something is reported and removed, it cannot be put up again. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-4">Luckily, there are some companies working on solutions to this problem. Twitch, a global streaming platform, bans IP addresses rather than user ids making it more difficult for problematic users to rejoin the platform. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-5">Still, there are benefits to reporting problems on technology platforms when you see them. The primary of which is that it holds tech companies accountable to their users. </p>

                <p>Institutions and third parties can <b>audit</b> algorithms. </p>
                <p>Auditing algorithms is crucial in mitigating algorithmic bias, and in reducing pressure on content moderators. Many, if not most, machine learning algorithms, which rely on big data, are black-boxes. However, there are many institutions, corporate, academic, and non-profit that are looking at frameworks that can audit algorithms and provide insight into an algorithm’s behavior, even without technical expertise. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text">The AI Now Institute at New York University has introduced a framework that governmental institutions can use to create Algorithmic Impact Statements (AIAs) which are able to evaluate the potential detrimental impact of an algorithm. This is not a new concept and has been created in the same vein as environmental, privacy, data, and human rights impact statements. Algorithms, by nature, are premeditated. And formal and regular auditing is not only the best practice for mitigating algorithmic bias, but in the best interests of both users and corporate institutions. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-2">Corporations can take steps without formal audits too. There are easy processes that can be incorporated into the regular testing step of the software development life cycle. For example, teams can compare outcomes for different groups in order to check for anomalous results. Or create simulations of predictions and compare them to the actual results produced by an algorithm. </p>

                <h3>What can <b>governments</b> do to combat algorithmic bias?</h3>
                <hr class = "line">
                <p>There are several steps governments can take in order to combat algorithmic bias from a regulatory perspective. The first is a change to Section 230. Section 230 is a 1996 law that allows Internet Services companies (including social media companies) to host user-generated content without being legally responsible for libelous speech or illegal content posted by their users. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text">Experts like Frances Haugen say that reforming Section 230 would make companies like Facebook responsible for their ranking algorithms and discourage engagement-based ranking. A.I. systems are not able to and likely will never be able to identify all instances of illegal content, and making companies responsible for their user’s content would force companies to rethink algorithmic feeds. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-2">Governments can also update non-discrimination and civil rights law to apply to digital practices and regularize algorithmic hygiene standards. </p>

                <h3>The solution to algorithmic bias in our technology <b>cannot</b> be strictly data driven. </h3>
                <hr class = "line">
                <p class="hidden-text">Many groups (including developers, companies, and institutions) have worked to reduce discrimination present in their algorithms and datasets, but this will never solve the problems of human nature, that each of these datasets will always be gathered by and tested with humans with bias. Avoiding bias is not possible without understanding how and why bias appears and that any human monitoring these systems will also have their own inherent biases. </p>
                <h3 class="hidden-text-2">All of the problems related to algorithmic bias are inextricably linked. </h3>
                <hr class = "line hidden-text-2">
                <p class="hidden-text-3">When we stop thinking about technology as infallible and as better than humans, we stop being overtaken by what is shiny and new, and we are better able to hold technology companies accountable for the issues present in their technologies. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-4">When technology companies move slower and take more time to consider the consequences of their work, when they think more about bias, and confront their own biases internally, and apply these mindful practices to both technologies that already exist, and to new technologies, then we get better algorithms that do not compromise on fairness and that serve all users in the best way possible. </p>
                <p class="hidden-text-5">When regulatory bodies force companies to innovate ethically and work to understand the true impact that technology has on demographic groups, they are not stifling innovation. Rather, they are creating innovation, the constraints posed allow for the development of improved, superior technologies which do not jeopardize users or morality. </p>
